**Overview**

Telecom companies face significant challenges in retaining customers. This analysis uses a dataset containing customer information and churn status, leveraging machine learning models to predict churn. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is available in the dataset folder and contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Gender: Gender of the customer

SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 or 0)

Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes or No)

Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes or No)

Tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company

PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes or No)

MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes or No)

InternetService: Type of internet service customer has (DSL, Fiber optic, or No)

OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (Yes or No)

OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes or No)

DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes or No)

TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes or No)

StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes or No)

StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes or No)

Contract: Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, or Two year)

PaymentMethod: Payment method of the customer (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, or Credit card)

MonthlyCharges: The amount the customer pays monthly

TotalCharges: The total amount the customer has been charged

Churn: Whether the customer has churned (Yes or No)
Installation

Edit

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis.git

cd Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

Load the dataset from the dataset folder.

Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Run the churn_analysis.py script to execute the analysis and generate results.

bash
Copy
Edit
python churn_analysis.py

**Methods Used**

The following machine learning algorithms were used for customer churn prediction:

**Logistic Regression**

**Decision Tree Classifier**

**Random Forest Classifier**

**XGBoost Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using cross-validation and different performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**Results**

The best-performing model based on the ROC-AUC score was XGBoost. The analysis achieved an accuracy of X%, with a recall of Y% for predicting churn.
